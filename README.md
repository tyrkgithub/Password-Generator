 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>A company have given me a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. They wants me to create code which helps keeps track of their finances.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To meet the clients requirements I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The total number of months are calculated and displayed</li>
    <li>The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period are calculated and displayed</li>
    <li>The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period are calculated and displayed</li>
    <li>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  are calculated and displayed</li>
    <li>The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period are calculated and displayed</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I have found w3schools to be highliy resourceful. On this website I have read up on the properties of arrays, variables, strings, math, booleans, if else, switch, and the for loop amoung others. Another resource I have used is stack overflow, a website where you can ask or find the answer to your coding problems.<br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>I have found this project the hardest task so far as more math has been needed. When I was able to get my head around the math, the task I hand became alot more digesttable</li>
   <li>I had misread one of the requirements to begin with. To save time and to prevent doing this again, I will put more time into planning on the next project</li>
   <li>.toFixed(2) makes a number display to 2 decimal places</li>
