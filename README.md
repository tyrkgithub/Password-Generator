  <br/>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>A company has requested that I create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To meet the clients requirements I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>When the button is clicked a series of prompts for password criteria are presented.</li>
   <li>The password criterias are whether these character types are included:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Numbers</li>
     <li>Uppercase</li>
     <li>Lowercase</li>
     <li>Special Characters</li>
    </ul>
   <li>After each prompt is selected, it should be validated with the user</li>
   <li>At least one character type needs to be selected</li>
  <li>The password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I have found w3schools to be highliy resourceful. On this website I have read up on the properties of arrays, variables, strings, math, booleans, if else, switch, and the for loop amoung others. Another resource I have used is stack overflow, a website where you can ask or find the answer to your coding problems.<br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>I have found this project the hardest task so far as more math has been needed. When I was able to get my head around the math, the task I hand became alot more digesttable</li>
   <li>I had misread one of the requirements to begin with. To save time and to prevent doing this again, I will put more time into planning on the next project</li>
   <li>.toFixed(2) makes a number display to 2 decimal places</li>
