# <h1>Week Five Challenge - Password Generator</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>This weeks challenge is creating Javascript code which generates a random password including the preferences of the user.</p>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>A company has requested that I create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To meet the clients requirements I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>When the button is clicked a series of prompts for password criteria are presented.</li>
   <li>The password criterias are whether these character types are included:</li>
    <ul>
     <li>Numbers</li>
     <li>Uppercase</li>
     <li>Lowercase</li>
     <li>Special Characters</li>
    </ul>
   <li>After each prompt is selected, it should be validated with the user</li>
   <li>At least one character type needs to be selected</li>
  <li>The password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I have found my one-on-one tutoring session to be highly resourceful. Things we discussed included: prompt, confirm, aler and isNaN. Another resource I have used is w3schools. This website explains how to use Javascript, give examples and has exercises for you to complete.<br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>I have found this project the hardest task so far as more math has been needed. This is the first assignment I have not completed for hand in day</li>
  <li>I have not completed this task and will need to put aside specifc time to finish this as well as utilising my next one-on-one</li>
   <li>To complete this task I will need to gain a better understanding of math.random, math.floor, and laying out functions</li>
